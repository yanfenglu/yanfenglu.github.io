  <h3>Photo Gallery</h3>

  <p>Over the years I have taken many photos in several areas at various places. I still need more time to sort and process them. On these pages I demonstrate some of my photo works. New items will be added when they are available. Brief background and photography comments are provided beside each work. For the sake of copyright protection, all the photos are watermarked. If you are interested in any image with higher resolution, please contact me.</p>

  <p><strong>Notes on the photo display system</strong>: Thumbnails of the photos are displayed together on the main page. Mouse hoovering on a photo triggers the corresponding comments being displayed. For better experience, clicking on any thumbnail brings the viewer into the virtual gallery exhibition. This system is adapted from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/slimbox/">an improved version</a> of the popular <a href="http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/">lightbox system</a>. I changed the lightbox view into a framed photo hanging on a wooden wall, to simulate the museum experience. Once you enter the virtual gallery, please make necessary adjustments through scrolling, zooming and/or brightness/contrast tuning, to obtain the best view for your particular window. Navigation in the exhibition is controlled by forward/backward buttons below the photo and/or the corresponding keys on the keyboard (&rarr;/&larr;; PageDown/PageUp; Enter/Backspace). To exit the gallery click on the "X" button below the photo or press the key Escape or X. You're welcome to use my adapted system, but please be a good netizen to add a link to my webpage, just like what I am doing here to the lightbox system.</p>

  <h4>American West</h4>
    <p>About two years after I began to work at Novell Inc. I felt I had the resource (money, time and energy) to pursue my interest in photography further. Once I made a significant upgrade of my photo gear I launched the project to photograph the American West. From 2002 to 2005 I made over a dozen photo trips to the natural parks and cities in the American West. On the trips I normally visited multiple places. In four years I was able to cover about 20 natural parks and all the major western American cities, with a majority of the places more than once. I left my foot prints in all the 11 western states. At the beginning I was not sure about my travel abilities. But after I tried a long journey with a friend in 2003, I became very confident. Later on I always travelled on my own. I found that's a good advantage for photo trips. I was lucky to live in Central Utah, the center of the American West, with almost every corner reachable in a day's drive. I had a secret to keep myself awake during long distance driving. In a typical photo trip I drove over 3000 miles in about 10 days. To catch sunrises and sunsets sleep was always not sufficient. For a 10 day photo trip I needed to prepare for a couple of weeks beforehand and process the results and recover for another couple of weeks afterwards. The following poem captures some aspects of my photo activities in the US.</p>

    <div id="poem">
    <h4>摄影途中</h4>
    <br>
    <p>我是一个追光人，</p>
    <p>痴迷于光和影的神韵。</p>
    <p>反光镜起落的咔哒声，</p>
    <p>总让我感到无比激动。</p>
    <br>
    <p>乘着滚滚的车轮，</p>
    <p>一阵尽情的狂奔。</p>
    <p>我热爱陪伴好友亲朋，</p>
    <p>我更爱独自天马行空。</p>
    <br>
    <p>我背着沉重的镜头机身，</p>
    <p>我的手指时刻不离快门。</p>
    <p>我仰慕高山的气势峥嵘，</p>
    <p>我敬畏大海的波涛汹涌。</p>
    <br>
    <p>无论山道崎岖险峻，</p>
    <p>三脚架总随身不分。</p>
    <p>游人还在甜美的梦乡中，</p>
    <p>我已在黎明等待太阳升。</p>
    <br>
    <p>当自然之母露出一丝甜美的微笑，</p>
    <p>所有的劳累少觉、蚊虫叮咬，</p>
    <p>所有的酷暑严冬、耐心苦等，</p>
    <p>都在顷刻间消融。</p>

    <p>The American West is a photographer's heaven, with so many photo generating places. There are still places I would like to visit, but couldn't. When chance comes I will photography there more. The works contained in this gallery represent what I arrived at. I group them into 5 sections below.</p>
  
  <h5>Landscape I: Mountains and Lakes</h5>
  <p>There are many beautiful mountains and lakes in the American West. This section features Olympic National Park, Mt. Rainier National Park, Yosemite National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake.</p>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/sl120-35_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>Hurricane Ridge</strong> Hurricane Ridge is part of the Olympic National Park, Washington. It's accessible via a dedicated road starting from Port Angeles in the north of the Olympic Peninsula. The early morning cloud added some  sense of remoteness and mystery to the snow-capped mountain ridge."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/sl120-35_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/sl75-12_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>Geyser</strong> Geysers are one of the key features that define the Yellowstone National Park in the US. There are hundreds of Geysers in the park, big or small. When the right pressure condition was reached the hot water would be shot high into the sky, creating a wonderful view. The people in the photo worked as a good reference."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/sl75-12_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/sl66-18_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>Bridalveil Fall</strong> The Bridalveil Fall is one of the famous falls in the Yosemite valley, California. It obtained its name due to its soft feel and slender shape. The warm late afternoon sunlight made the rocks a good contrast to the white fall and white clouds in the blue sky."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/sl66-18_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    </tr><tr>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/sl74-07_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>Moran Reflection</strong> Mt. Moran is located mid-way from Yellowstone to the Grand Teton, Wyoming. Besides the lake reflection I intentionally put some grasses in the foreground to add the comparison between the grasses and the mountains, another interesting element to the photo."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/sl74-07_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/sl160-23_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>Rainier Reflection</strong> This photo was taken at the Reflection Lakes in the Mt. Rainier National Park, Washington. Since it's a famous reflection point, if I just took a direct reflection shot that would be too ordinary. So I included the flowers in the foreground to add some unique interest."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/sl160-23_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/sl103-04_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>Utah Lake Sunrise</strong> This sunrise photo of Utah Lake was made on a field trip with the Wasatch Camera Club on a cold winter morning. Interesting points in this photo included the irregular snow-covered mud patches in the foreground, the aerial perspective and the contrast between the warm sunlight and the cold winter scene."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/sl103-04_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    </tr><tr>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/slR161-07_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>Rainier with Meadow</strong> To get this close view of Mt. Rainier one needs to hike up the trail starting from the main visitor center of the park. There are many meadows on the way. They are dotted with flowers in the right season. The sky in this photo was darkened with a polarizing filter to enhance contrast."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/slR161-07_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/slR180-19_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>River Rocks</strong> This photo was taken in the Merced river near the entrance to Yosemite valley, California. A neutral density filter was used to increase the exposure time further. The long exposure was necessary to create the blurred effect in the water."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/slR180-19_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/sl172-05_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>Great Salt Lake Sunset</strong> The Great Salt Lake in Utah is the biggest lake with salt water similar to the sea water. It's originally part of the sea and the water composition has been kept that way. The two people gave life to this beautiful sunset scene."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/sl172-05_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    </tr><tr>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/sl7-04_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>Fall and Canyon</strong> This is a famous view in the Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. The name 'Yellowstone' probably came from the yellow rocks in this Yellowstone river canyon. This photo has the feel of a Chinese landscape painting, although having some people in it would make it a lot better."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/sl7-04_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/sl68-15_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>Cathedral Rocks</strong> The rocks and pine trees in the Yosemite National Park look very close to Huang Shan in Anhui, China. The water in the photo was not a lake. This high water level didn't happen each year. It's a sheer luck that I ran into this reflection view. So it's interesting by itself."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/sl68-15_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land1/sl5-18_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland1" title="<strong>The Grand Teton</strong> The most beautiful mountain in the American West, in my opinion. Jackson Hole, the presidential resort, is right at the foot. Although it stood by itself I still included extra interest in the foreground. A polarizing filter was also used to darken the sky."><img src="images/photos/america/land1/sl5-18_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

  <h5>Landscape II: The Red Country</h5>
  <p>The red country is a unique geological phenomenon in the American West. There are similar formations elsewhere, but no other place with such a vast area. Spread mostly in Utah and Arizona the colorful sand stones, gone through thousands of years of erosion by the weather, have offered us these wonderful sculptures of Mother Nature. This section features Arches National Park, Dead Horse Point State Park, Canyonlands National park, Capitol Reef National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, Zion National Park and Grand Canyon National Park.</p>
  
  <div id="photo">
    <table class="photoGallery"><tr>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl83-29_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Towers of the Virgin</strong> These majestic rocks are located behind the Human History Museum in the Zion National Park, Utah. In order to emphasize the natural color the photo had to be taken in the early morning. The dry grass on the ground during this season also matched the rocks well."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl83-29_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl112-31_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Grand Canyon</strong> This photo was taken in the Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. Clouds over the canyon was a very rare occasion. And the light angle was just right to generate the depth in the photo. Without the foreground being lit up it would be a mundane work."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl112-31_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl90-25_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Hoodoo Army</strong> The hoodoo army is a unique geological formation in the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah. The hoodoo was created with layers of sand stones eroded by the weather. The pink twilight in the sky resonated with the color of the hoodoos."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl90-25_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    </tr><tr>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl44-03_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Dead Horse Point</strong> This is a Utah state park. Here we see the same erosion work of the Colorado river as in Canyonlands and the Grand Canyon. The composition and lighting condition helped create the depth in the photo."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl44-03_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/DSC_0044_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Canyon Land</strong> This photo was taken in the Canyonlands National Park, Utah. Compared with the Grand Canyon, the color of the rocks here is a little darker. The main interest of the photo was the curved lines along the edges of the canyon ground."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/DSC_0044_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl48-15_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Window</strong> Windows are the early stage of the erosion that happens day and night in the Arches National Park, Utah. This is one of the most famous windows in the park. I used the window to frame the blue sky with white clouds. The interplay of the three colors was rather vivid."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl48-15_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    </tr><tr>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl17-30_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Autumn Colors</strong> This was a showcase of colors. The different shades of autumn colors of the trees in the foreground was overlaid on the pink stone wall in the background. The curved lines in the trees also contrasted with the straight lines on the wall. The photo was made in the Capitol Reef National Park, Utah."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl17-30_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl84-34_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Red Tower</strong> This tower is right beside the Canyon Scenic Drive in the Zion National Park, Utah. Facing this tower were cliff hangers climbing on the walls. The polarizer-saturated blue sky provided a good contrast to the red tower."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl84-34_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl51-27_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Landscape Arch</strong> The Landscape Arch is the arch with the widest span in the Arches National Park, Utah. To emphasize the wide span a good shooting angle needed to be carefully found. Putting the arch on the dark blue sky was part of the effort."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl51-27_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    </tr><tr>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl96-31_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Barn</strong> The barn was the biggest interest in this photo, taken in the Capitol Reef National Park, Utah. The color of the barn resonated with that of the stone wall behind. The blue sky provided contrast and an extra layer, and therefore enhanced depth."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl96-31_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl93-02_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Moon over the Canyon</strong> This was another interpretation of the Bryce Canyon in Utah, now with the moon. The moon and the several outstanding hoodoos in the foreground were the two main interest points in the photo. As we look at the photo our eyes would move up and down. This tension creates dynamism."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl93-02_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land2/sl42-09_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland2" title="<strong>Delicate Arch</strong> This is definitely the most famous arch in the Arches National Park. It is even used as the icon of Utah. The lighting condition was critical for photographing the Delicate Arch. The arch stood out in this photo because of that."><img src="images/photos/america/land2/sl42-09_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    </tr></table></div>

  <h5>Landscape III: Deserts</h5>
  <p>People often associate deserts with unpleasantness, sterility, or even death. Here the opposite side of deserts is displayed. In fact deserts also contain pleasing beauty and vibrant life. This section features Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park and Saguaro National Park.</p>
  
  <div id="photo">
    <table class="photoGallery"><tr>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/sl54-16_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Zabriskie Point</strong> The Zabriskie point is one of the many attractions in the Death Valley National Park, California. The main interest lies in the wave like rock formation. The best lighting condition appears in the early morning, the moment right before the rock waves are lit up."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/sl54-16_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/sl110-34_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Saguaros</strong> This photo was taken in the Saguaro National Park, Arizona. The word 'saguaro' in Spanish means water sucker. One tree could suck tons of water during a rain in the Sonoran Desert. The silhouette against the sunset sky emphasized the magnificent shape of the giant cactus trees."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/sl110-34_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/sl104-12_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Wind Mills</strong> When I visited the Joshua Tree National Park in California I chose the first stop at Palm Spring, a famous resort. These wind mills were right outside Palm Spring, beside the road to the park. To create the effect of the spinning propeller the right shutter speed was critical. Depending on the speed of the propeller the exposure should last around a second."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/sl104-12_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/slR110-08_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Cactus Closeup</strong> There are many species of cactuses in the Saguaro National Park, Arizona. This is one with big leaves. No, the 'leaves' are in fact branches and the needles are leaves. This closeup shot was meant to highlight the beautiful curves."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/slR110-08_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    </tr><tr>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/sl25-07_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Joshua Trees</strong> Another specialty in the American Deserts. There are tens of thousands of Joshua trees in the Joshua Tree National Park, California. But I never saw one elsewhere. I tried to use the triangle composition in this photo, but unfortunately there was a little overlapping on the right side."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/sl25-07_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/slR147-36_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Sand Dune</strong> There is a floating sand field in the Death Valley National Park, California. New sand dunes were formed after each big wind. That's the prime time for photography. This photo emphasized the rippled pattern and the curved line on the edge."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/slR147-36_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/slR109-04_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Giant Shrub</strong> I don't know the name of this giant plant in the Joshua Tree National Park. It's beside the main road of the park. The blue sky provided the best background for this gorgeous blooming shrub."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/slR109-04_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/sl111-17_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Cactus Flowers</strong> Don't be seduced by the alluring cactus flowers! The needles could give you both pain and numbness. My American photo friends felt uneasy with this composition. They said it looked like two eyes staring at them. But I personally still like this unevened even composition."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/sl111-17_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    </tr></tr>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/slR141-14_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Life in the Death Valley</strong> Life is definitely not excluded from the Death Valley. Sometimes it could even flourish like in this case. Since the Death Valley is generally hotter, this actually happened in February. The yellow flower patch was apparently the main interest of the photo. The mountains and sky offered context and depth."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/slR141-14_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/slR111-30_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Saguaro Blooms</strong> This was a closeup shot of the Saguaro arm with flowers. There was no reference in the photo, but the flower was really big. As usual, the polarizer-darkened sky was a good background."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/slR111-30_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/slR142-24_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Badwater Sunset</strong> The badwater in the Death Valley National Park is the lowest point of North America, well below sea level. The foams in the foreground was also a main interest of the photo. To make them sharp hyperfocal distance focusing had to be used, since the foams were right under my camera."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/slR142-24_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/land3/slR108-19_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-usland3" title="<strong>Rocks and Tree</strong> Rocks were another major attraction of the Joshua Tree National Park. This photo was meant to demonstrate the harmony between the rocks and the tree. The low angle of the early morning sunlight was best to highlight the round shape of the rocks."><img src="images/photos/america/land3/slR108-19_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    </tr></table></div>

  <h5>Seascape</h5>
  <p>The US has a long Pacific coast line on the west side. It belong to three states, Washington, Oregon and California. I didn't have much chance to explore the coast. My focus was on Olympic National Park, San Francisco and San Diego.</p>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/sl100-10_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>La Jolla Beach</strong> The La Jolla Beach is a famous vacation destination in San Diego. There one can see many surfers and sea birds and seals in their natural habitat. As shown in this photo the rocks there are also attractive. I included the dancing water to add dynamism to the photo."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/sl100-10_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/sl123-27_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>Ruby Beach 1</strong> The Ruby Beach is located in the Olympic National Park, Washington, facing the Pacific Ocean. It's one of the photographers' favorite sites, thanks to its rocks and forests. The rocks helped create the depth and some dynamism in this mostly serene sunset shot."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/sl123-27_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/slR189-05_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>Golden Gate Bridge 1</strong> Crossing over the Golden Gate of the San Francisco bay this suspension bridge was a technological wonder, and a scenery wonder too. With its eye catching red color and elegant shape, it looked so pleasing on the background of the blue sky. The fog just added some sense of mystery and more alluring power to it."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/slR189-05_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/sl101-20_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>Pacific Beach</strong> The Pacific Beach is one of the famous beaches in San Diego. I arrived just in time to catch the setting sun. Clouds were always helpful for a sunset shot. And the people on the beach gave life to the generally calm scene."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/sl101-20_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/slR125-08_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>Ruby Beach 2</strong> This is an early morning shot of the Ruby Beach. The main interest lay in the rocks far away. But I also included some interesting elements, the rippled pattern on the beach, in the foreground. This photo was not scanned well. I'll redo it later."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/slR125-08_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/slR189-24_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>San Francisco Skyline</strong> This was not a direct shot of the San Francisco skyline, which would be too common. Instead I treated the skyline as the background and put more emphasis on the rocks in the foreground and the house and bridge on the middle layer. You can find this view near the Fort Point."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/slR189-24_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/slR188-35_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>Sea Bird</strong> This closeup shot of a sea bird was made on a pier near the Golden Gate. Birds in such places were normally not that afraid of approaching people. So I could take this photo only with a medium range telephoto zoom lens."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/slR188-35_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/sl186-19_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>Golden Gate Bridge 2</strong> This was a landscape format shot of the Golden Gate Bridge, taken on the hill on the other side of the Golden Gate. Bathing in the warm late afternoon sunlight the bridge became even more brilliant. And the white cloud was also tinted with pink, floating harmoniously around the bridge."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/sl186-19_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/sl101-34_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>Pier 1</strong> This is one of the piers located on the beach facing the La Jolla Beach in San Diego. UC San Diego is right behind it. The main interest was a sunset seascape. The pier in this case was a charming decoration."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/sl101-34_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/slR189-09_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>Water Tower</strong> This was inside the Fort Point, an essential fortress by the Golden Gate. Once up the time all the ships passing through the Golden Gate were within the range of cannons placed in the fortress. Now it becomes a tourist attraction. 'Water Tower' was just my guess. I was more interested in its other characters than function."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/slR189-09_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/slR188-04_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>Shore Rocks</strong> This was also taken in the Golden Gate Park. I loved the dark rocks with green mosses on them. They were the main interest in the photo. The pier filled the space in the upper half nicely. And the horizontal pier line worked well with the slant shore line together."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/slR188-04_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/sea/sl100-15_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-ussea" title="<strong>Pier 2</strong> This is another pier facing the La Jolla Beach in San Diego. In this case the pier was the main subject, because there was not much interest in the surroundings. The golden glow of the pier as a result of the warm sunlight was critical. The black dots in the water were surfers."><img src="images/photos/america/sea/sl100-15_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

  <h5>Cityscape</h5>
  <p>The American West fosters quite a few great cities, especially along the Pacific coast. As you can see my interpretation of the cities was intimately associated with my landscape photos. In the photos of this section I viewed the cities from the perspective of a landscape photographer. Six western American cities are featured here: Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angles, San Diego, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas.</p>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/city/sl99-19_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-uscity" title="<strong>Mormon Temple in Christmas Lights</strong> Salt Lake City is where the Mormon headquarters are located. The Mormon Temple Square is decorated with bright lights during the Christmas season. In this photo I included a pool on the square at the bottom to reflect the generally symmetric night scene."><img src="images/photos/america/city/sl99-19_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/city/sl118-24_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-uscity" title="<strong>Space Needle</strong> The space needle, a landmark of Seattle, was built as a part of the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair. This was an unusual view from a park nearby. The big wheel was included to have a comparison with the round platform. The tip of the needle, highlighted with the warm light of the setting sun, stood out on the blue sky."><img src="images/photos/america/city/sl118-24_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/city/sl101-10_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-uscity" title="<strong>Balboa Park 1</strong> The Balboa Park is a major attraction of San Diego. There are many lavish European style buildings in the park. In this photo I used a very calm pool to make a nearly perfect mirror image of one of the buildings."><img src="images/photos/america/city/sl101-10_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/city/DSC_1480_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-uscity" title="<strong>Saks Fifth Avenue</strong> This was a street view in San Francisco. To avoid a common shot of a building I overlaid the image of a plant on top of the building. I also tried to put the street lamp in the right position, so that its lid filled the space in the upper-left corner well."><img src="images/photos/america/city/DSC_1480_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/city/DSC_2255_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-uscity" title="<strong>Palace and Fountain</strong> The strip in Las Vegas is a no sleep street. There are so many lights lit overnight. Here I put the new Caesars Palace building and the Bellagio music fountain in the same photo. The fountain moved all the time. It demanded some stamina to get a good composition."><img src="images/photos/america/city/DSC_2255_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/city/sl101-04_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-uscity" title="<strong>Balboa Park 2</strong> This was another photo from the Balboa Park. The things interested me here were the comparison between the tower and the palm tree and the forward pointing arrow on the road. They both contributed to the composition."><img src="images/photos/america/city/sl101-04_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/city/DSC_2182_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-uscity" title="<strong>MGM</strong> This was a side view of the MGM Casino in Las Vegas. Apparently the main objects in the photo were the three bowls. The main interest lay in their shape, size and position. The contrast between the bowls and the main body of the building and the perspective were based on them."><img src="images/photos/america/city/DSC_2182_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/city/DSC_1150_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-uscity" title="<strong>Seattle Skyline</strong> We have a very different view of the space needle in this Seattle skyline photo. The fast moving red boat was critical for this photo. It filled the foreground and contributed to the depth. It gave life to a otherwise much more static photo."><img src="images/photos/america/city/DSC_1150_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

Paul  Getty. The museum in it was open free for public access. I took the reflection of the buildings in this photo. The mother and son, with his pointing arm, at the corner added another layer to it."><img src="images/photos/america/city/DSC_2079_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/city/DSC_1026_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-uscity" title="<strong>Pike Market</strong> The Pike market is a must-visit if you are in Seattle. In the market you could taste fresh crabs by the counter and see the salesmen throw fishes from one to another through the air. In this case I was attracted by the vibrant colors of the clothes and balloon works of this street artist."><img src="images/photos/america/city/DSC_1026_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>

    <td><a href="images/photos/america/city/DSC_1593_wm.jpg" rel="lightbox-uscity" title="<strong>Fisherman's Wharf</strong> The fisherman's wharf was my last stop in San Francisco. Besides tasting the fresh seafood I didn't miss any chance to take photos. This signboard was made in the form of a helm. It's difficult to let it separate from the building, which would make it a better photo."><img src="images/photos/america/city/DSC_1593_thumb.jpg" alt="Click!"></a></td>
